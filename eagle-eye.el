;;; Install:

;; Put this file on your Emacs-Lisp load path, add following into your
;; ~/.emacs startup file
;;
;;     (require 'eagle-eye)
;;
;; Enable eagle-eye-mode in any buffer to scale down the text in that buffer by
;; set scale. Disabling the minor-mode will bring the text size back to normal.
;;
;;     (eagle-eye-mode)
;;
;; You can also set key-bindings to functions `eagle-eye-zoom-in' and
;; `eagle-eye-zoom-out', so that you can change text size across Emacs at once.
;;
;;     (global-set-key (kbd "C->") 'eagle-eye-zoom-in)
;;
;;     (global-set-key (kbd "C-<") 'eagle-eye-zoom-out)
;;
;; The eagle-eye text scaling can be set as
;;
;;     (eagle-eye-set-text-scaling 5)
;;
;; Also, you can set the step by which zooming in and zooming out happens by
;;
;;     (eagle-eye-set-zoom-step 10)
;;
;; By default, the eagle-eye text scaling is 5 and zoom step is 10.
;;

;;; Commentary:

;;     You can use this package to change the text-size across Emacs at once or
;;     suddenly zoom out to get an eagle-eye view then take it back to normal.
;;
;;  Overview of features:
;;
;;     o   Change text size in steps
;;     o   Temporarily zoom-out and then get back to normal
;;
